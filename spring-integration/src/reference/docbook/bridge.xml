    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      A Messaging Bridge is a relatively trivial endpoint that simply connects two Message Channels or Channel
      Adapters. For example, you may want to connect a <interfacename>PollableChannel</interfacename> to a
      <interfacename>SubscribableChannel</interfacename> so that the subscribing endpoints do not have to worry
      about any polling configuration. Instead, the Messaging Bridge provides the polling configuration.
    </para>
    <para>
      By providing an intermediary poller between two channels, a Messaging Bridge can be used to throttle inbound
      Messages. The poller's trigger will determine the rate at which messages arrive on the second channel, and the
      poller's "maxMessagesPerPoll" property will enforce a limit on the throughput.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another valid use for a Messaging Bridge is to connect two different systems. In such a scenario, Spring
      Integration's role would be limited to making the connection between these systems and managing a poller
      if necessary. It is probably more common to have at least a <emphasis>Transformer</emphasis> between the
      two systems to translate between their formats, and in that case, the channels would be provided as the
      'input-channel' and 'output-channel' of a Transformer endpoint. If data format translation is not required,
      the Messaging Bridge may indeed be sufficient.

    <title>Configuring Bridge</title>
    <para>
      The &lt;bridge&gt; element is used to create a Messaging Bridge between two Message Channels or Channel Adapters.
      Simply provide the "input-channel" and "output-channel" attributes:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<int:bridge input-channel="input" output-channel="output"/>]]></programlisting>
      As mentioned above, a common use case for the Messaging Bridge is to connect a
      <interfacename>PollableChannel</interfacename> to a <interfacename>SubscribableChannel</interfacename>, and when
      performing this role, the Messaging Bridge may also serve as a throttler:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<int:bridge input-channel="pollable" output-channel="subscribable">
     <int:poller max-messages-per-poll="10" fixed-rate="5000"/>
 </int:bridge>]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Connecting Channel Adapters is just as easy. Here is a simple echo example between the "stdin" and "stdout"
      adapters from Spring Integration's "stream" namespace.
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<int-stream:stdin-channel-adapter id="stdin"/>

 <int-stream:stdout-channel-adapter id="stdout"/>

 <int:bridge id="echo" input-channel="stdin" output-channel="stdout"/>]]></programlisting>
      Of course, the configuration would be similar for other (potentially more useful) Channel Adapter bridges, such
      as File to JMS, or Mail to File. The various Channel Adapters will be discussed in upcoming chapters.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>If no 'output-channel' is defined on a bridge, the reply channel provided by the inbound Message will
      be used, if available. If neither output or reply channel is available, an Exception will be thrown.</para>
