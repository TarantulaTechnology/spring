 * A Message Router that sends Messages to a list of recipient channels. The
 * recipients can be provided as a static list of {@link MessageChannel}
 * instances via the {@link #setChannels(List)} method, or for dynamic behavior,
 * the values can be provided via the {@link #setRecipients(List)} method.
 * <p>
 * For more advanced, programmatic control of dynamic recipient lists, consider
 * using the @Router annotation or extending {@link AbstractMappingMessageRouter} instead.
 * <p>
 * Contrary to a standard &lt;router .../&gt; this handler will try to send to
 * all channels that are configured as recipients. It is to channels what a
 * publish subscribe channel is to endpoints.
 * <p>
 * Using this class only makes sense if it is essential to send messages on
 * multiple channels instead of sending them to multiple handlers. If the latter
 * is an option using a publish subscribe channel is the more flexible solution.
